Description: This package provides a suite of tools for Bayesian psychometric analysis,
    including functions for evaluating factor loadings and model fit indices using
    Bayesian methods. The functions leverage the capabilities of the blavaan package
    and other tidyverse tools to deliver intuitive visualizations and numerical summaries
    of posterior distributions, thereby facilitating robust model evaluation and diagnostics.
